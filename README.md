Hi! This is my final project for my educational institution. A Zombie Wave game made in Python. I've been developing it for 2 weeks! I think if anyone is interested, I left the source code here.

Installation instruction:
1. Download main.exe and assets.zip.
2. Place the files to any folder.
3. Unpack assets.zip to folder where is main.exe.
4. Launch main.exe.

DON'T TOUCH THE PROGRESS.TXT FILE! 
If you will get an error while playing game or you will shutdown your computer while playing you will ned to delete your progress.txt file.
