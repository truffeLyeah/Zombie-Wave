Hi! This is my final project for 2024 year in my programming school. A Zombie Wave game, made with Python and Pygame. I've been developing it for 2 weeks! If anyone is interested, I left the source code here.

UPD: this code so sucks and there's a few russian comments so sry 🥲 I'M TOO LAZY TO REWRITE IT and the game itself sucks so I abandoned it

Installation instruction:
1. Download main.exe and assets.zip.
2. Place the files to any folder.
3. Unpack assets.zip to folder where is main.exe.
4. Launch main.exe.

DON'T TOUCH THE PROGRESS.TXT FILE! 
If you will get an error while playing game or you will shutdown your computer while playing you will need to delete your progress.txt file.
